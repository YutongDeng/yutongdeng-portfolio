    During my previous academic year at Columbia University, I developed a deeper understanding of the relationship between architecture and society. I am not only concerned with the space itself, but also whether architecture can be used as political or cultural measures to have a greater impact on society. Especially the most sensitive nowadays such as climate change, population issues and the new discussion of architecture under the plague brought by the pandemic situation.
